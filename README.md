# Test python code 

All this code is from a basic Python course. Some of it is me messing around with Python 3 to see what it can do. The stuff in parser is a made up project to create a parsing architecture in python capable of parsing log messages into some kind of meaningfull `json` output.

## course

Test programs and excersises relating to plurasight [Core python3: getting started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/getting-started-python-core/table-of-contents) course on [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/). 
## parser

The `KV` parser in `kv_py_parse.py` is a very basic `KV` that translates a string in the form `key` = `value` to a dict object. No type conversion is done and error checking is minimal. 

For more details about the parser please checkout the [parser design document](parser/docs/design.md).


## Old 

Old python `first attempts` kept to show progress. Other progress can be gleaned by going through the git history.
