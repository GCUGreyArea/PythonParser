# Test python code 

All this code is from a basic Python course. Some of it is me messing around with Python 3 to see what it can do.

## course

Test programs and excersises relating to plurasight `Core python3: getting started` course. 
## parser

The `KV` parser in `kv_py_parse.py` is a very basic `KV` that translates a string in the form `key` = `value` to a dict object. No type conversion is done and error checking is minimal. 


## Old 

Old pythong `first attempts` kept to show progress.
